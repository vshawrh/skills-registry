## Canonical Contract System

Contracts are contributor-facing optimization specs: functions describe the published job-to-be-done, metrics describe what should improve, and measures state how each metric is scored today.

### Functions

| Function | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `plan` | Choose an approach, sequence, or strategy before execution. |
| `retrieve` | Locate and return source material, facts, or artifacts needed for later work. |
| `analyze` | Interpret inputs to extract structure, meaning, or implications. |
| `review` | Assess an artifact against expectations and identify issues, risks, or fit. |
| `generate` | Produce a new artifact for the user or another tool to consume. |
| `transform` | Rewrite or convert existing input into a different form while preserving intent. |
| `verify` | Check whether a claim, artifact, or result satisfies explicit criteria. |
| `execute` | Carry out a bounded operational task in tools, CLIs, or external systems. |
| `orchestrate` | Coordinate multiple steps, tools, or subagents into a larger workflow. |

### Metrics

| Metric | What It Optimizes | Measurement Guidance |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `task_success` | Whether the skill completes the intended job correctly for the task. | Prefer deterministic or verifier-backed checks; use judge only as a fallback. |
| `tool_correctness` | Whether chosen tools and tool calls are valid and appropriate. | Usually deterministic or verifier-backed from tool traces and outcomes. |
| `argument_correctness` | Whether tool inputs, flags, and parameters are correct. | Usually deterministic or verifier-backed from arguments and downstream results. |
| `evidence_completeness` | Whether claims and verdicts are backed by enough concrete evidence. | Use verifier-backed checks when evidence can be counted; otherwise use a rubric-backed judge. |
| `step_efficiency` | Whether the workflow uses a reasonable number of steps for the task. | Deterministic only; count steps against an explicit budget or baseline. |
| `latency` | How quickly the skill produces the final usable result. | Deterministic only; measure elapsed wall-clock time for the user-visible outcome. |
| `token_efficiency` | How economically the skill uses model tokens. | Deterministic only; measure prompt/completion token consumption. |
| `context_footprint` | How much context the skill requires to do the job reliably. | Deterministic only; measure required files, tokens, or supporting artifacts. |
| `output_quality` | Human-judged quality of the final artifact when deterministic checks are insufficient. | Judge only; always pair it with a stable rubric_ref and, when available, calibration data. |

### Measures

| Measure | When To Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `deterministic` | Use when a direct oracle or exact check can score the metric consistently. |
| `verifier_backed` | Use when a programmatic verifier can judge success, but not by simple exact match. |
| `judge` | Use rubric-based human or LLM evaluation only when deterministic checks are insufficient. |

Skill tables below show metric ids with the current measure in parentheses.
